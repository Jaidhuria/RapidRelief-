# RAPID-RELIEF: Disaster Resource Relief Allocator

## 📖 Overview
RAPID-RELIEF is a centralized, intelligent platform designed to **optimize disaster relief resource allocation** during emergencies such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones, and landslides.  

The system integrates **AI triage, GIS mapping, and automated allocation algorithms** to minimize delays, reduce duplication of efforts, and improve fairness and transparency in aid distribution.  

It connects **citizens, NGOs, and administrators** through role-based web interfaces, real-time disaster mapping, and AI-driven decision support.

---

## 🎯 Motivation
During large-scale disasters, traditional relief efforts often suffer from:
- Fragmented reporting and duplicate requests  
- Lack of real-time coordination between agencies  
- Delays in allocation and delivery of resources  
- Missing aid in critical severity zones  

RAPID-RELIEF was built to:
- Aggregate SOS needs in real time  
- Verify and prioritize urgent requests  
- Match verified requests with capable NGOs/resources  
- Provide transparent tracking and delivery confirmations  

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
The absence of a **centralized, intelligent relief coordination system** results in:
- Chaotic allocation and duplication of efforts  
- Delays or missing aid in critical areas  
- Poor situational awareness for responders and administrators  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
**Primary Objective**:  
To build a **smart, centralized platform** for quick, fair, and organized distribution of disaster relief materials.  

**Functional Objectives**:
- Real-time mapping of disaster zones  
- Citizen SOS submission (form + AI chatbot)  
- NGO dashboards for inventory & request management  
- Admin verification workflows  
- Automated resource allocator  
- Notifications & alerts  
- Analytics and public transparency portal  

**Non-Functional Objectives**:
- Low latency (<5s allocation)  
- High availability (99% uptime)  
- Secure role-based access  
- Offline resilience for poor connectivity

## 📍 Scope & Applications
**In Scope**
- Single-incident disasters (floods, earthquakes, landslides, cyclones)  
- NGO and volunteer coordination  
- Resources: food, shelter, medicine, rescue, blankets, water, clothing  

**Applications**
- NGO collaboration & coordination  
- Municipal disaster response (Smart Cities)  
- Refugee/migrant aid operations  
- Rapid first-responder support in urban & rural zones
